| *Extra*   |   ![[Extra Class Book Cover.jpg]]<br>[Amazon](https://a.co/d/heQG1wJ)    | FOR TESTS AFTER JULY 1, 2024 Special Low Introductory Price Won't Last Long  <br>Amateur radio license tests are multiple-choice, with four answers for each question. Traditional test-prep materials go through the questions and all the possible answers. For the Extra test, you see 603 questions and 2,412 answers, but 1,809 answers are wrong! Why be confused and frustrated studying three wrong answers? The Easy Way is different. The focus is on the right answers and only the right answers with full explanations - All Ham and No Spam®. The book is in three parts. The first explains the concepts covering every test question with hints and cheats to help you understand and recognize the correct answer. The second part is a condensed summary with one or two lines of the question and the correct answer. The third part is a quick review of just the question and answer. Since you never see the wrong answers, the correct answers will pop out when you take the test. You learn to recognize, not memorize, the right answer. It couldn’t be easier!  <br>Here are two testimonials: "I just wanted to let you know that I purchased all 3 of your amateur radio license study books, read them all 3 repeatedly, and passed all three tests in 3 weeks! 1st week Tech, 2nd week General, and 3rd week Extra class. Your books give the information needed to understand the material and questions and, in turn, give the reader the knowledge and confidence to pass the exams. I have wanted to get involved in amateur radio for years, and now I have! I will be sure to let everyone interested in amateur radio study material to be sure and read Easy Way Ham Books! Thank you for writing these books."  <br>"Thanks for writing the "Pass Your Test The Easy Way" books! I got my Tech license in May. I scored 34/35. I got my General in June and scored 35/35. I just passed my Extra Class test this week and scored 50/50. I went to the same VE's for each test. After the Extra exam and some handshakes, they had questions about how I studied. I showed them my copy of your Extra class book, highlighted, notes written in the margins, and so on. I used your books for each exam, and they definitely made a difference for me. I did my part as well, but your books definitely made it easier. The books are now part of the ham radio reference section in my library. I don't normally go out of my way to thank an author; in fact, I've never done this before, but your books made such a big difference for me that I felt I should reach out and let you know about it. So, thanks again for writing this series, 73! " |
