The **Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES)** is a program in the United States that uses licensed amateur radio operators for emergency communications. #RACES was established by the **Federal Emergency Management Agency #FEMA)*and operates under the authority of the **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)**. It is specifically designed to support civil defense and disaster response efforts during emergencies where amateur radio communications are needed.

### Key Features of RACES:

1. **Purpose**:
    
    - To provide emergency communication support during situations requiring civil defense.
    - To operate as a backup communication system for government agencies during disasters, such as natural disasters, wars, or other emergencies.
2. **Membership**:
    
    - Limited to licensed amateur radio operators who are registered with a local civil defense or emergency management agency.
    - RACES operators are officially enrolled in their respective jurisdictions (county, city, or state).
3. **Authority**:
    
    - Operates under FCC Part 97 rules, specifically Sections 97.407 and 97.401(b), which define RACES operations and its restrictions.
    - Can only be activated by a government agency (e.g., a local Office of Emergency Management).
4. **Activation**:
    
    - RACES is activated only during emergencies where government authority deems it necessary.
    - Unlike the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES), RACES is strictly tied to governmental operations and cannot be activated for non-governmental purposes.
5. **Training**:
    
    - RACES members often participate in drills, exercises, and training to prepare for real-world emergencies.
    - Training is coordinated with local emergency management agencies to ensure alignment with emergency response plans.
6. **Capabilities**:
    
    - Like ARES, RACES operators use amateur radio frequencies and various modes (voice, digital, CW, etc.).
    - However, RACES operates exclusively on frequencies authorized by the FCC for amateur radio and only during RACES-authorized events or emergencies.
7. **Differences Between RACES and ARES**:
    
    - **RACES**:
        - Tied to government agencies and used for civil defense.
        - Operates only during specific emergencies or drills authorized by government officials.
    - **ARES**:
        - More flexible and not limited to government activation.
        - Can support non-governmental organizations and public events in addition to emergencies.
8. **Historical Context**:
    
    - RACES was originally conceived during the Cold War to ensure communication continuity in case of a nuclear attack or major disaster.
    - Its role has since evolved to focus on modern disaster and emergency response.

RACES provides a vital link between amateur radio operators and government agencies, ensuring that communication lines remain open during critical situations when conventional systems fail. It complements other amateur radio emergency services, such as ARES, with a focus on governmental coordination and civil defense.
