**DXCC entities** defined by the **ARRL DX Century Club (DXCC)** program. #DXCC is a well-known awards program in amateur radio, where operators attempt to make contact with as many entities as possible. These entities are not strictly countries; instead, they are geographic or political areas defined by specific criteria.

### Key Points About DXCC Entities:

1. **Criteria for Recognition**:
    
    - Geographic separation (islands, remote locations, etc.).
    - Political independence or status.
    - Other special designations (e.g., certain UN regions or treaty-defined zones).

1. **Examples of DXCC Entities**:
    
    - Standard countries, such as the United States, France, or Japan.
    - Semi-autonomous regions or overseas territories, like Puerto Rico (USA), French Polynesia, or the Falkland Islands.
    - Special administrative regions, like Hong Kong and Macau.
    - Uninhabited or remote areas that meet specific criteria, such as Antarctica or certain unclaimed islands.

1. **How Many Are There?**
    
    - Currently, the official list includes **340 current active entities**, with additional deleted entities recognized for historical contacts. The total, including these, exceeds 400.

1. **List Management**:
    
    - The ARRL updates the DXCC list periodically based on geopolitical changes or re-evaluations.
