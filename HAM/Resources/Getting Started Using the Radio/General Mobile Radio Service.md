### **How GMRS Works:**

1. **Channel Sharing with FRS:**
    
    - GMRS shares frequencies with **FRS ([[Family Radio Service]])**, but GMRS radios can transmit at higher power (up to 50 watts for GMRS vs. 2 watts max for FRS).
2. **Repeater Access:**
    
    - GMRS radios can use repeater stations to extend the range of communication. These use the **repeater input channels** in the 467 MHz range.
3. **Licensing:**
    
    - A GMRS license is required from the FCC to operate on GMRS frequencies. It covers you and your immediate family and is valid for 10 years.
4. **CTCSS/DCS Tones:**
    
    - GMRS often uses **CTCSS or DCS tones** to access repeaters or prevent interference.

### **GMRS Usage Example:**

- **Channel 1 (462.550 MHz):** Great for direct communication between GMRS radios.
- **Repeater Channel 15 (467.550 MHz):** Used to access a local GMRS repeater.
