"**A satellite operating in U/V mode uses an uplink in the 70-centimeter band and a downlink in the 2-meter band.** Think of it as a repeater within an offset using two different bands. 
*Hint: 70 centimeters (420-450MHz) is UHF, and 2 meters (144-148MHz) is VHF. Up 70, down 2.* 

*Cheat: Look for the answer with "in the 70-centimeter band"*"
