# Introduction to Amateur Radio
***The purpose of the [[Amateur Radio Service]] #ARS is advancing the skills in the technical and communication phases of the radio art. 

*Hint: Radio art? That off phrase gives away the answer*

• There are over 800,000 amateurs in the United States

• **The [[FCC]] regulates and enforces the [[Amateur Radio Service]] in the United States
• [[FCC]] rules always apply

• [[Citizen Band]] is limited to 5 watts *(about the same as a night light)*
• Licensed amateurs can operate with up to 1,500 watts

## Three classes of license

# Who Are You?

The [[FCC]] assigns #CallSign to radio stations. For instance WMAL is a popular radio station in Washington, DC. Radio amateurs also receive a unique call sign issued by the [[FCC]]. The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) allocates call sign groups to different countries.

US call signs begin with ***W, K, N, or A***. An amateur whose call sign begins with ***DL*** would be in Germany. A call sign starting with ***PY*** would be from Brazil. 340 [[Recognized Entities]].
## Ten numbered districts divide the United States (0-9)
![[USA_Call_Sign_Map-2678926022.png]]
*Numbering rules only apply to original issue

When operating out of your area, you can use a self-assigned indicator. Examples might be ***KLL7CC/W3*** (KL# = Alaska | W3 = mid-Atlantic region).
*KL7CC stroke W3
***"Stroke" | "Slash" | "Slant" = /

**When using #tactical identifiers, your station must transmit the [[FCC]]-issued call sign every 10 minutes during and at the end of a conversation.

**Use of the phonetic alphabet is encouraged by the [[FCC]] when identifying your station when using phone.

# Where Can You Operate?


Your US amateur radio license entitles you to operate **from any vessel or craft located in international waters and documented or registered in the United States**, in addition to the US and territories. *Remember, "International waters."*

**[[FCC]]-licensed amateur radio stations are prohibited from exchanging communications with any country whose administration has notified the [[International Telecommunication Union]] that it objects.

**A non-licensed person is allowed to speak to a foreign station if the foreign country has a third party agreement with the United States.


---
# What Do We Talk About?


**Permitted international communications must be incidental to purposes of the [[Amateur Radio Service]] or remarks of a personal nature.

**Transmissions that contain obscene or indecent language are prohibited, but there is no list of banned words.

**An amateur station may transmit music only when incidental to manned spacecraft communications.

**Broadcasting is a prohibited one-way transmission by an amateur station.** Hams aren't to engage in "broadcasting." **Broadcasting means transmission intended for reception by the general public** instead of transmissions sent to a particular station. **Broadcasting, program production, or news gathering is authorized, assuming no other means is available where such communications relate to the immediate safety of human life or protection of property.

There is another exception for beacons. **The [[FCC]] defines a beacon as an amateur station transmitting for the purpose of observing the propagation or related experimental activities.** You can listen for beacons to see if the band is open from their location to yours.

**Willful interference to other amateur radio stations is permitted at no time.

# Who Can You Talk To?

# Who Is In Control?

**Repeater, #auxiliary and space stations can automatically retransmit.** They are types of repeaters, and repeaters automatically retransmit. "Auxiliary" is a repeater for repeaters.

# Propagation

multipath #propagation 
#HF vs #VHF
#UHF
auroral #backscatter

Radio waves can refract off more than just the ionosphere and buildings. One example is "tropospheric ducting." Tropospheric ducting is caused by temperature inversions in the atmosphere. Layers of different-temperature air trap the waves, which bounce along until they squirt out some distance away.

Several layers divide the ionosphere, commonly referred to as the D, E, and F layers. The sun energizes these layers, and they exhibit different characteristics depending on the time of day, time of year, and the amount of energy coming from the sun.

The E layer has a component that can be unpredictable and sporadic #SporadicE **Occasional strong over-the-horizon signals on the 10, 6, and 2-meter bands are sporadic E.** *Cheat: If you see "sporadic" in an answer, it is correct.*

# How to Start a Conversation


If you are not using a repeater, call #CQ.
**CQ means calling any station.

**On a repeater in place of CQ, say your call sign followed by the word "monitoring."** *"K4IA monitoring."* 

**To call another station on the repeater, if you know his call sign, say the other station's call sign, then identify with your call sign.** *"KF1XXX, this is K4IA"*

**If two stations on the same frequency interfere with each other, they should negotiate continued use of the frequency.** Common courtesy, bot no one has an absolute right to a frequency.

**To respond to a #CQ, transmit the other station's call sign followed by your call sign. 

	KF1XXX: 
		CQ, CQ, CQ,. This is KF1XXX, Kilo Foxtrot 1 Xray Xray Xray."
	K4IA:
		KF1XZXX, this is K4IA, Kilo 4 India Alpha."

### #TestQuestion
**Before calling #CQ:**
• Listen first to be sure no one else is using the frequency
• Ask if the frequency is in use
• Make sure you are authorized to use that frequency

# Operating Simplex


**If you are transmitting and receiving on the same frequency, it is simplex communication.

It helps to start on a frequency where others commonly listen. These are "calling frequencies." **The national calling frequency for #FM simplex operations in the 2-meter band is 146.520MHz. #146_520MHz #ImportantFreqs 

Call CQ to establish a simplex contact. **The meaning of the procedural signal "CQ" is calling any station.** Say "CQ, CQ, CQ, this is K4IA calling CQ and listening." We don't use CQ on a repeater.

### #TestQuestion 
**Before choosing an operating frequency for calling #CQ:**
• Listen first to be sure no one else is using the frequency
• Ask if the frequency is in use
• Make sure you authorized to use that frequency

### Tips
• **When responding to a #CQ, transmit the other station's call sign followed by your call sign.
• Identify every ten minutes and at the end of your communication
• Call sign identification for a station transmitting phone signals can be CW or phone emissions.

## Decibels

Decibels are logarithmic (power of 10) and relate to relative change. **Going from 20 to 200 watts is 10 times or 10 dB.** Going from 200 watts to 2000 watts is another 10 dB.

The change is not linear. **Going from 5w to 10w is 3 dB.** Doubling is 3 dB. Half power is -3 dB. **A power decrease from 12w to 2w is -6 dB.**

### Antenna Lengths

### #TestQuestion 
**"How long is a 6 meter half-wavelength dipole?"**
*6m = full wavelength, so 6/2=3 for half. A little over 9ft x 12in so **112in.***

### Directional Antennas

#antenna #gain is the increase in signal strength in a specific direction compared to a reference antenna

**A beam antenna concentrates signals in one direction.** We call them "beams" because they beam the signal in one direction. A #Yagi is a type of beam.

**Between a 5/8-wave vertical, isotopic, J pole, and Yagi, the #Yagi offers the greatest gain.** The other named antennas are not directional.

**Frequencies above 400MHz use a Type N connector.** The type N is a different plug design that is waterproof. It is harder to solder to coax.

### Coaxial Cables

**The characteristic** #impedance **most often used for** #coax **is 50** #ohms

### #TestQuestion 
**A source of loss in coaxial feed lines is:**
• High #SWR
• Multiple connectors in the line


### Antenna Analyzers and #SWR

#SWR **Standing Wave Ratio** is a measure of how well the load is matched

### Batteries

### #TestQuestion 
**Rechargeable batteries include:**
• Nickel-metal hydride
• Lithium-ion
• Lead-acid
